My name is Codrin Parmac, and I'm a computer science student at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer-Science.

This repository houses all of the projects I've completed for university up to this point. You won't find courses, seminars, or small assignments; only more significant projects.
