My name is Codrin Parmac, and I am a computer science student at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer-Science.

This repository houses all of the projects I've completed for university up to this point. I don't promise that everything will work perfectly, but I gave everything I had.
